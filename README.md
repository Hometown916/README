# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

## Introduction

Hello! I am Okawa Masaaki, a passionate blockchain developer with a keen interest in decentralized technologies and cryptographic security. This GitHub account showcases my projects, contributions, and experiments in the blockchain space.

## About Me

I specialize in developing secure and scalable blockchain solutions. My expertise includes:

- **Smart Contract Development**: Proficient in Solidity and other smart contract languages.
- **Blockchain Architecture**: Designing and implementing blockchain networks.
- **Cryptographic Algorithms**: Implementing secure cryptographic protocols.
- **Decentralized Applications (DApps)**: Building user-friendly DApps on various blockchain platforms.

## Featured Projects

### Dapper-Contracts
- **Description**: This repository implements the Dapper Ethereum smart contract wallet. The wallet has recovery and multi-signature capabilities (via cosigner address) as well as allowing for users to have full sovereignty over all features.
- **Technologies Used**: cryptography, ethereum, smart-contracts, cryptocurrency, solidity.
- **Key Features**: In contrast to the standard HD wallet implementation, rather than an externally owned account, all assets (ETH, ERC20, ERC721, etc.) for the user are associated with the wallet's public address (contract account) for which by construction there exists no private key; hence value transfer actions from the wallet to another address require function calls to be performed on the wallet itself. For importing assets, one simply sends them to the user wallet contract address.

### PRBContracts
- **Description**: I initially created this library to streamline my personal workflow, as I was tired of having to maintain identical contracts across multiple repositories. However, if you find this library beneficial to your own projects, that's a win-win situation for both of us.
- **Technologies Used**: library, ethereum, smart-contracts, solidity, erc20.
- **Key Features**: Designed for Solidity >=0.8.4, Uses custom errors instead of revert reason strings, Complementary to OpenZeppelin's library, Well-documented via NatSpec comments, Thoroughly tested with Foundry
